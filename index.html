                        <p>I have worked in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, WordPress customization! I have
                              experience working with many clients in the local market! Now this is planning stage. Once
                              I get the sketch into Illustrator, I have to determine a lot of things.</p>

                        </div>


                        <p>Once we have chosen your base font size, you should then think about the scale and hierarchy
                              of the remaining typographical elements, like headings, subheadings, and menu items. After
                              you’ve defined a scale, we should stick with that scale throughout our entire design. This
                              will make.</p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="half-width box-item-3">
                        <div class="illus-img background-3">
                              <img src="illustrators/illustrator-2.png" alt=""><br>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                              <h3>goal</h3>
                        </div>


                        <p>I usually define two points. I call them Anchor Points. I setup my body text size and also my
                              largest header first, and then I fill in the numbers in between. These two anchor points
                              allow me to evenly distribute my scale throughout the range of type elements on my page.
                              Now let’s move on to rule.</p>

                  <p>Unless your website has a compelling need for a custom font, such as for branding purposes or to
                        create an immersive experience, it’s usually best to stick with the system fonts. Keep in mind
                        that good typography draws the reader to the content, not to the type itself.</p>

                  <p>Communication plays a vital role in design —it’s essential to establish a clear connection between
                        the website and user and to help your users accomplish their goals. When we talk about
                        communication in web design context, we usually mean text. </p>
